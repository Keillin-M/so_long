What is MiniLibX?
MiniLibX (short for Mini Library X) is a tiny, easy-to-use graphics library designed for beginners learning how to program simple graphical applications. It helps you create windows, draw images, and display text on the screen without needing complex setup.

Think of MiniLibX as a basic toolkit that lets your computer program show things visually — like colors, shapes, or pictures — instead of just printing text in a terminal. It’s commonly used in programming schools or learning projects because it’s simple and perfect for practicing how to make graphics work.
